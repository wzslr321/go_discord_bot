> Talk Bot is meant to communicate with user, basing on entered data

#

#### Uses prefix and displays menu of options when invoked
#### Gives possibility to create Embed message, calculate values with decimal numbers precision and check actual time
  

#

> To use Talk Bot just install **go** locally and type `go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo`

> Afterwards, type `go build` to build a bot

> If built properly, you have to run `./tallky_bot -t <TOKEN> ` 

#

> Example : `./ bot -t NzU5MDEwNXc0ODgwMjEwOTQ4.X23R3g._DE86FVVc9kG7F_XXet7Q00oOQw`

> I have started creating this bot after just few hours of learning GoByExample.
> I finished it 24 hours after my first line of code in Golang, so there is still a lot to improve for sure.
